            <article>
                <p> There are eight different species of bear: North American black bears, brown bears, polar bears, Asiatic black bears (also known as moon bears due to the white, crescent-moon-shaped marking on their chests), Andean bears, panda bears, sloth bears, and sun bears. Each species is recognizable by its distinct size, markings, and characteristics.

            <article>
                <p>Giraffes are highly social animals and live in herds of 15-20 female giraffes and some young males. Male calves will leave their mothers and the herd from around 15 months and join bachelor herds of other young males. The female calves tend to stay with the same herd as their mothers but can leave after the age of around 18 months old, and most often stay in the same areas as the family herd they grew up in.</p>

                <p>Lions are highly social cats, living in prides of up to 40 members. Each female tends to stay in her birth pride, whereas most young males leave the pride in small groups (coalitions) to create their own.</p>

                <p>For monkeys, picking bugs, dirt, and other debris off their companions is far from an indictment of their personal hygieneâ€”it's an expression of affection and love. Grooming rituals not only keep monkeys healthy, they also strengthen their social bonds and, ultimately, make them feel more comfortable. Researchers have discovered that when vervet monkeys comb each others' pelts, it fluffs the fur and makes it thicker. </p>

            <article>
                <p>Larger male alligators are solitary, while smaller alligators tend to stay in close social groups near to each other. They fiercely defend their territory. Alligators diet on fish, reptiles, birds and smaller mammals they can kill with a single bite. They do sometimes pull animals into the water to drown them, before consuming. They are an apex predator and have been known to attack larger animals such as panthers and bears.</p>
